# snake_game_with_gui
Overview:
This is an enhanced version of the classic Snake game implemented using Python and the Tkinter library. The base code for the Snake logic was inspired by Bro Code (Link to his youtube below), but significant modifications have been made to improve gameplay and user experience. This version includes a graphical user interface (GUI) with interactive features such as a Start Game button, Play Again button, and additional functionality to display game levels, messages, and dynamic difficulty.

Features
Start Button:
A button on the main screen allows the player to start the game.

Play Again Button:
After the game ends, a button appears to allow players to restart the game without restarting the program.

Level System:
The game includes a level system where the difficulty increases as the player earns more points. The level caps at Level 5.
Every 5 points, the level increases, and the snake moves faster.

Dynamic Game Speed:
The snake's speed dynamically adjusts as the player progresses to higher levels, providing a challenging experience.

Game Info Messages:
Level-Up Notification: A message briefly appears in the center of the screen when the player advances to the next level.
Game Over Screen: Displays the "Game Over" message and the highest score achieved during the session.

Highest Score Tracker:
Tracks and displays the highest score during the session.

Python 3.x
Tkinter (Comes pre-installed with Python)
